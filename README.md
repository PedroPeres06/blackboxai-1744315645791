# Fusion Logs

## Project Overview
Fusion Logs is a web-based logging and monitoring application that provides users with an interface to log in, create accounts, reset passwords, and view dashboard analytics related to system logs. The application employs a modern design with dark mode support and is built using HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript, providing a responsive and user-friendly experience.

## Installation
To run the Fusion Logs project locally, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/fusion-logs.git
   cd fusion-logs
   ```

2. **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser:**
   You can simply double-click the `index.html` file or open it through your web browser's "Open file" dialog.

3. **For local development:**
   Consider using a local server (like Live Server in VSCode) to avoid issues with file access in some browsers.

## Usage
- Visit the home page by opening `index.html` in a web browser.
- You can create a new account by navigating to the register page (`register.html`).
- If you forget your password, you can reset it using the link on the login page (`forgot-password.html`).
- After logging in, you will be directed to the dashboard (`dashboard.html`) where you can view analytics and recent logs.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Users can log in and create accounts easily.
- **Password Management:** Users have the capability to reset their password if forgotten.
- **Dashboard Analytics:** Provides insights into logs, error rates, and user activities.
- **Responsive Design:** The application adapts to different screen sizes.
